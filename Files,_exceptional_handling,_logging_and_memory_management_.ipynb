Interpreted setups typically trade raw speed for flexibility and ease of iteration; compiled setups generally deliver faster execution and stronger compile-time checks."

        "#### Ans :  Using logging in a program offers several advantages that are crucial for development, debugging, and maintenance. Instead of simply printing messages to the console, logging provides a more structured and powerful way to record events .\n",
        "\n",
        ">### 1. Persistent Record\n",
        "\n",
        ">- Unlike print statements, which disappear after the program closes, logging allows you to save messages to a file. This creates a persistent record of events that you can review later to understand the program's behavior over time. This is especially useful for long-running applications or when diagnosing issues that only occur in specific environments.\n",
        "\n",
        ">### 2. Controlled Output\n",
        "\n",
        ">- Logging allows you to control the level of detail you see. You can set different logging levels (such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL) to filter messages. For example, you can set the level to INFO in a production environment to see only important messages and then switch to DEBUG in a development environment to see all the detailed output\n",
        "\n",
        ">### 3. Structured Information\n",
        "\n",
        ">- Log messages can include crucial metadata like a timestamp, the source module, the line number, and the severity level. This structured information makes it much easier to pinpoint the exact location and time of an event. A simple print statement lacks this context, making it harder to track down the source of an error.\n",
        "    \n",
        ">### 4. Flexibility and Centralization\n",
        "\n",
        ">- Logging allows you to send messages to multiple destinations, or handlers, simultaneously. You can configure logs to be written to a file, sent to a remote server, displayed on the console, or even sent via email. This flexibility is a significant advantage over simple print statements, which are limited to the standard output.\n",

        "\n",
        ">- Logging is an invaluable tool for debugging. By strategically placing log messages in your code, you can trace the program's execution flow and inspect variable values at different stages. It also provides an audit trail for security and compliance purposes, as it can record user actions, system events, and potential security threats.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Ans : When we open a file in Python using open(), the operating system reserves resources like memory and a file handle to interact with that file. If we dont' close the file after finishing, several problems can happen. That's why closing a file is important.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. ### Releases system resources\n",

        "2. ### Ensures data is saved (writes are flushed)\n",

        ">- When we write to a file, Python usually stores the data in a temporary buffer (not immediately in the file).\n",
